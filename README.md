# Security Intelligence Learning Journal

## 📅 February 2026
### Feb 23: Information Security & Risk Foundations
* **Learning Objective:** Establishing a baseline for security architecture and threat analysis.
* **Concepts Mastered:**
    * **The CIA Triad:** Deep dive into Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
    * **Risk Equation:** Analyzed the relationship between Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Business Impact.

### Feb 24: Network Communications & Protocol Logic
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Message Segmentation:** Understanding how large data is broken into smaller pieces for network efficiency.
    * **Protocol Requirements:** Studied encoding, formatting, and timing in digital communication.
* **Analysis:** Recognized how standardized protocols ensure interoperability across diverse hardware.

### Feb 25: Network Architecture & Infrastructure Foundations
* **Learning Objective:** Mapping physical network layers and understanding device-level connectivity.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Device Categorization:** Distinguishing between End Devices (PCs, Servers) and Intermediary Devices (Routers, Switches, Firewalls).
    * **Connectivity Media:** Analyzed the use cases and vulnerabilities of Copper, Fiber-optic, and Wireless connections.
* **Analysis:** Identified that physical and logical topology mapping is essential for defining the "attack surface" in a Security Intelligence role.
  
### Feb 26: Wireless Connectivity & Mobile Networking
* **Learning Objective:** Understanding how mobile devices interact with various wireless network types and the associated security protocols.
* **Coursework:** Completed Module 3 of Cisco "Networking Basics."
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Wireless Standards:** Explored Wi-Fi (802.11), Bluetooth, NFC, and Cellular (4G/5G) technologies.
    * **Mobile Connectivity:** Studied how Android and iOS devices manage Wi-Fi settings and automated network switching.
    * **Security Precautions:** Analyzed the importance of WPA2/WPA3 encryption and the risks of sending plaintext data over public hotspots.
* **Analysis:** Noted that mobile devices increase the "attack surface" of a company, requiring stronger endpoint security and VPN usage for remote data access.

### Feb 27: Home Network Architecture & Security
* **Learning Objective:** Implementing and securing a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environment.
* **Concepts Mastered:**
    * **Gateway Configuration:** Setting up an integrated wireless router to connect local devices to the ISP.
    * **Security Implementation:** Configuring SSIDs and implementing WPA2/WPA3 encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
    * **DHCP Services:** Understanding the automated assignment of IP addresses to end devices for local communication.
* **Analysis:** Building a home network highlighted that security is not a "default" state; it requires intentional configuration of the gateway to protect internal data from external threats.

### Feb 28: Network Gateway Configuration & Verification
* **Learning Objective:** Finalizing SOHO network builds and reflecting on home-to-ISP connectivity.
* **Concepts Mastered:**
    * **Router Setup:** Detailed configuration of local gateways and wireless access point parameters.
    * **Home Technologies:** Analyzed the interaction between local devices and the ISP's external infrastructure.
    * **Diagnostic Reflection:** Completed the "Webster Reflection" to troubleshoot common connectivity failures.
* **Analysis:** Recognized that securing the "Entry Point" of a network is the first line of defense; misconfigured home gateways create easy pivot points for attackers to access sensitive corporate data.
